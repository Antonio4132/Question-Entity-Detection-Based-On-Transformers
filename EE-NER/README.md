# EE-NER

This experiment uses biomedical NERs to detect entities from a basic hand-crafted dataset of questions. When detected the small dataset is transformed to templates. The later are then used to augment the dataset using information from a ontology.

The next command is used to launch the nextflow script:

```
nextflow run ee-ner.nf
```
